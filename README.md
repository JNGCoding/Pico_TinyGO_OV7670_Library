# 📷 Pico_TinyGO_OV7670_Library

A modular TinyGO library for interfacing the **OV7670 camera module** with the **Raspberry Pi Pico**. Designed for flexibility, this library supports dynamic resolution settings and both grayscale and RGB color capture—ideal for embedded vision applications.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Dynamic resolution support (e.g., 160×120 to 640×480 and beyond)
- 🌈 RGB and grayscale image capture modes
- 🔄 Raw image transmission over Serial to host computer
- 🖼️ Optional bitmap conversion for desktop viewing
- 🧩 Modular architecture for easy integration and extension
- ⚙️ Written in idiomatic TinyGO for embedded efficiency

---

## 🧪 Trial Runs

- Successfully captured and transmitted a **320×240 grayscale image**  
- Raw image data sent over Serial and post-processed into a **bitmap**  
- Image made window-accessible for desktop visualization

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

This library is ideal for developers working with:

- Embedded image sensors  
- TinyGO-based microcontroller projects  
- Custom logging, streaming, or image processing pipelines  
- Cross-platform desktop tools for embedded data visualization

---

## 📚 Future Plans

- Add support for SD card logging  
- Implement real-time RGB streaming  
- Provide desktop companion tools for image parsing and display  
- Expand documentation and usage examples
